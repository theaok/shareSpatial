Recent CITE Rubia livability find spaital patterns in wellbeing across europe with
north west being most satisfied and south east least. \citet{fuentes17} find
that the relationship between binge drinking and SWB is moderated by region. In
present study we want to find out how the relationship of volunteering, social
transfers and SWB vary across countries. 

There have been many studies on cross-country differencs in SWB (eg mine about
eur and cite ruut) and about diff in volunteering (haski the one from oecd that
leszek emailed in dec2017 in word some writep), but no study on the varying
effect of volunteering and pensions on swb across countries. 
we build on $<$blind for peer review$>$  % socTraCocCap
just extend across countries
 



\citet{duda16} %sec7.3
review several studies using SHARE and finding similar
pattern: North is happier than South.

Welfare helps general population
\citep{radcliff01,pacek08b,pacek08r,radcliff13,aokJap14} and so it does help elderly
in Europe \citep{motel09,niedzwiedz14}. Importantantly, welfare was found not to
crowd out the helping among people \citep{motel05}. In fact there is evidence to
the contrary, the more welfare (and civil liberties), the more volunteering
\citep{hank10}.
%
There is however evidence, that familism \citep{banfield67}, or Southern
informal high level of relations and engagement within family networks tend to
crowd out the formal forms of engagment such as volunteering
\citep{kohli09,pichler07}. Being from Poland, we expect that similar mechanism may be at work in Eastern Europe.



We know that volunteering varies by country \citep[e.g.,][]{hank09}. This study
will focus on testing whether there is a varying effect from volunteering on SWB
by country. 

This study contnues a line of research focusing on cross-country comparisons
\citep{hank05,hank09}. We focus on subjective wellbeing as an consequence  of
volunteering; that is we are not interested here in antecdants of volunteering
neither in other consequences. 

Note, however, the goal of the present study is not to investigate what
predicts or affects volunteering cross nationally as in \citet{hank05,hank09},
but to examine the subsequent link, the link between volunterring and wellbeing cross-nationally.


have bar charts or tablesor key vars for each country, like in my earlier
cross=area paper s like one with mari or my earlier stuff for SIR

heck just redo overall paper broken down by country and again, have country in
rows and effects as 95 perc CI--there is some stata command for that

build on livability paper with rubia :)



Finally, we would like to test a proposition that effects differ across countries. % {For
  % instance, literature suggests that Northerners are more  satisfied with
  % social contacts \citep{bonsang12}.}and way more social transfers!
Perhaps, there are two clusters, North-Western and South-Eastern:\\
% Specifically, North-West is more individualistic (e.g., volunteering) and
% South-East is more collectivist (e.g., collectivist social capital and social transfers):\\ 

\noindent$H_3:$ Social transfers  will have
higher payoff in happiness in South-Eastern Europe; Volunteering will generate more
happiness in North-Western Europe.\\ %ee (mayble also south):lezy sie is sie



Finally, we expect large cross-national differences: what works in one
country may not work in another. Population aging in Europe is a fact, and
governments already grapple with spending pressures and budget deficits. What is
the best way to care about our seniors and ensure decent levels of wellbeing? We
hope to produce new knowledge in this area.  

\section{Literature}

Choi's environmental factors and structural factors such as region, urbanicity,
religion, life styles and social roles affect volunteering \citep[][cited in]{hank09}.
 We are inteested in finding whether similar factors can also affect the
 relationship between volunteering and wellbeing. 

Haski09 found rel between vol and swb strongest in countries with least of
it--not surpising--like educ in us--syates with fewest ppl taking sat like tx
highest score; in general these who go first those with greatest inclination, so
unfortunately increasing vol may have diminishing marginal returns

%FROM lm docx: info dla adama
Haski (2009) as the main reference. A list of empirical papers on volunteerism among elderly (Erlinghagen and Hank, 2006; Wahlendorf and Siegriest, ?)
Main findings in Haski (2009)
positive relation between volunteering and physical and psychological well-being.
volunteering rates differ among countries  in the way known from earlier studies - the highest rates in Northern Europe and the lowest rates in Southern Europe
volunteering influences perceived health and life satisfaction  differently in different countries
puzzle : no clear relation between impact of volunteering on health and quality of life and extend of volunteering (Italy compared with the Netherlands) in the wave 1 of SHARE
Research question (robustness check) -- Is it possible to find association between extend of volunteering and health and quality of life using different data (SHARE wave 6 instead of SHARE wave 1) 
 Extensions in our paper
Wave 6 instead of wave 1
New formulation of question on volunteering (12 months instead of 4 weeks)
New countries (Eastern Europe)
New measure of association between popularity of volunteering and its relation to subjective health and life satisfaction (Kendall's tau-b instead of Pearson's correlation)
New measure for life satisfaction ( casp instead of 4 point Likert scale)
Summary of results

mostly copied from the other one

Here we take the perspective as in \citet{hank10} and look at three dimensions
of social capital (and 'productive aging') % hank calles them dimensions of
                                % productve aging, guess fine; but seems more
                                % accurate to say dimensions of soc cap!
\begin{itemize}
\item volunteering:  done voluntary or charity work
\item informal helping: provided help to family, friends or neighbors
\item caring: cared for a sick or disabled adult 
\end{itemize}

TODO: note the differenceL now volunteering in past XXX, earlier it was in past
XXX as in \citet{haski09}

\section{Results}

graphs: guess have a bar charts: volunteering and especially informal helping
like ghto---again as per ersa the idea is that there is cultuer: in south east
more familism! yes ! do talk about familism!!

have bar chart replicating tab2 and tab4 from hank05--disuss variaton in
informal help!

We also have ghto variable--the advantage--available for many cases (from
imputed dataset), but not really asmuch volunteering as rather helping and
assisting as opposed to voluntary taking part in community life; furthermore it
may point to unhappiness, at least unhappiness around as helping is probably
often induced by unhappiness of people who need help.  


CASP and life satisfaction correlate at .6, and while in general countries high
on one and hogh on the other one and low on one and on teh other one, there are
some notable differences shown in figure \ref{ls-casp-means}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

%relating to lm ideas
So we also fins as in \citet{haski09} that highest volunteering is in Northern
counrties and lowest in Southern and effect differs by country

volunteeringh and frq of volunteering are closely related in fig \ref{volCha-volChaOft-means}

\begin{figure}[H]

in fig \ref{reg-volCha}
so largest effect in south--interesting! guess the poorer the more vol matters!
same as in 1st paper !

\section{Discussion}

TODO add from ERSA as per culture etc etc

Volunteering is related to SWB. And many European countries have very low rates
of volunteering. So what are the practical implications? Volunteering could be
induced--there are many ways to activate this yet unused potential of idle
elderly \citep[e.g.,][]{atkinson2006mobilizing,henkin2006communities, butler2007civic,Butts,howgate2008increasing,zedlewski2007we}. And
there is a role for institutions of higher education to promote civic engagement
and community development in general, not only among the elderly. See, for instance,
initiatives at Rutgers-Camden \url{http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/civic-engagement}.
 Such initiatives could be copied by institutions of higher education in
 European countries with low engagment, such as Poland.
